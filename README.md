```docker compose up --build```

This is a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines a **multi-container application** using Docker Compose. It includes **three services**: a MySQL database, a Flask backend, and a React frontend. Let‚Äôs break down each part in detail:

---

## üîß `version: '3.8'`

Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.
Version `3.8` supports modern Docker features, including service dependencies and networking.

---

## üß± `services:`

Defines the three services (containers) to run:

---

### 1. **`database`** ‚Äî MySQL container

```yaml
  database:
    build: ./database
```

* **`build: ./database`**
  Builds a Docker image using the `Dockerfile` inside the `./database` directory.

```yaml
    container_name: mysql_db
```

* **`container_name: mysql_db`**
  Names the container `mysql_db` (optional, mainly for readability and easier reference).

```yaml
    restart: always
```

* **`restart: always`**
  Restarts the container automatically if it crashes or if the system reboots.

```yaml
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
```

* **Environment variables** passed to the MySQL container:

  * `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Sets the root user password (`password`)
  * `MYSQL_DATABASE`: Creates a new database named `mydb`

```yaml
    ports:
      - "3307:3306"
```

* Maps **host port `3307`** to **container port `3306`** (default MySQL port).
  So you can connect to MySQL locally at `localhost:3307`.

---

### 2. **`backend`** ‚Äî Flask container

```yaml
  backend:
    build: ./backend
```

* Builds from `./backend`, which should contain a `Dockerfile` to start the Flask app.

```yaml
    container_name: flask_app
    restart: always
```

* Names the container `flask_app`, and restarts it on failure or reboot.

```yaml
    depends_on:
      - database
```

* Ensures the **MySQL database starts before** the backend does.

```yaml
    environment:
      DB_HOST: database
      DB_USER: root
      DB_PASSWORD: password
      DB_NAME: mydb
```

* Passes environment variables used by Flask to connect to MySQL:

  * `DB_HOST: database` ‚Üí refers to the **service name**, not `localhost`
  * These credentials match what MySQL was set up with.

```yaml
    ports:
      - "5001:5000"
```

* Maps **host port `5001`** to **container port `5000`**
  (Flask usually runs on `5000` inside the container)

---

### 3. **`frontend`** ‚Äî React container

```yaml
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    container_name: react_app
    restart: always
```

* Builds from the `./frontend` directory (where the React app and its Dockerfile are located).
* Names the container `react_app` and restarts on failure.

```yaml
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

* Maps **host port `3000`** to **container port `3000`** (React dev server)

```yaml
    stdin_open: true
```

* Keeps the container‚Äôs STDIN open ‚Äî useful for interactive debugging or development.

```yaml
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

* Waits for the backend container to start before launching React.
  (React might fetch data from Flask APIs, so it depends on it.)

---

## üì° Networking

All services share the **default Docker network**, and they can **communicate using their service names** (e.g., `database`, `backend`).

---

## üîÅ Summary Flow

```
React App (localhost:3000)
    ‚Üì fetches from
Flask Backend (localhost:5001)
    ‚Üì connects to
MySQL DB (localhost:3307, inside container it's just 'database':3306)
```
